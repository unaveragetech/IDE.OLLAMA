   - **Implementation**: Uses `requests` for HTTP requests and `json` for parsing responses.

#### Important Algorithms

1. **Cosine Similarity Calculation**:
   - **Algorithm**: Computes the cosine similarity between two vectors using the formula \(\cos(\theta) = \frac{A \cdot B}{\|A\|\|B\|}\).
   - **Complexity Analysis**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the vector.

2. **Unified Diff Application**:
   - **Algorithm**: Applies a unified diff to a file using the `patch` library.
   - **Complexity Analysis**: \(O(m + n)\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are the lengths of the original and modified sequences, respectively.

#### Error Handling Strategies

- **File System Events**:
  - The script handles `watchdog` events by catching exceptions that may occur during file operations.

# Execution

### Technical Documentation for `ide.py`

#### Code Complexity Level: Complex

The file `ide.py` serves as a core component of an integrated development environment (IDE) application. It handles various functionalities such as file indexing, event handling, and code diffing. Below is a detailed documentation of the key implementation patterns, architectural decisions, important algorithms, error handling strategies, and dependencies.

#### Key Implementation Patterns

1. **Modular Structure**: The script is organized into several modules for better readability and maintainability.
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Utilizes `watchdog` to monitor file system events in real-time, allowing the IDE to respond dynamically to changes in project files.
3. **Threaded Operations**: Uses threading to handle multiple tasks concurrently, improving performance and responsiveness.

#### Architectural Decisions and Rationale

1. **File Indexing with Watchdog**:
   - **Rationale**: `watchdog` is chosen for its ability to efficiently monitor file system events without significant overhead.
   - **Implementation**: The script initializes an `Observer` instance and registers a custom event handler (`FileSystemEventHandler`) to process changes.

2. **Event Handling**:
   - **Rationale**: Event-driven design ensures that the IDE can respond quickly to user actions or file modifications.
   - **Implementation**: The `handle_event` method processes different types of events (e.g., `modified`, `created`, `deleted`).

3. **Code Diffing with Difflib**:
   - **Rationale**: `difflib` is used for its simplicity and effectiveness in comparing text sequences.
   - **Implementation**: The script uses `Differ` from `difflib` to generate line-by-line differences between two versions of a file.

4. **Threaded Operations**:
   - **Rationale**: Threading allows the IDE to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, enhancing performance and user experience.
   - **Implementation**: The `threading` module is used to create separate threads for different operations like indexing or diffing.

#### Important Algorithms

1. **File Indexing Algorithm**:
   - **Description**: Uses a combination of file system traversal and event handling to build an index of all files in the project.
   - **Complexity Analysis**: O(n) where n is the number of files, with additional O(log n) for event processing.

2. **Code Diffing Algorithm**:
   - **Description**: Compares two versions of a file using `difflib` to generate line-by-line differences.
   - **Complexity Analysis**: O(m + n), where m and n are the lengths of the two sequences being compared.

#### Error Handling Strategies

1. **Filesystem Events**:
   - **Strategy**: The script handles various types of events (modified, created, deleted) by checking the event type and updating the file index accordingly.
   - **Example**: If a file is modified, it updates the index with the new content; if a file is deleted, it removes it from the index.

2. **Indexing Errors**:
   - **Strategy**: The script catches exceptions during file reading or indexing and logs them for debugging purposes.
   - **Example**: If an error occurs while reading a file, the script prints an error message and continues processing other files.

3. **Diffing Errors**:
   - **Strategy**: Uses `try-except` blocks to handle any issues that arise during the diffing process.
   - **Example**: If `difflib` encounters an issue, it returns a default result or logs the error.

#### Dependencies and Integration Points

1. **Third-Party Libraries**:
   - **numpy**: Used for cosine similarity and vector math operations in code analysis.
   - **patch**: Provides functionality to apply unified diffs, useful for comparing and merging file contents.

2. **Integration Points**:
   - **Filesystem Events**: The script integrates with the `watchdog` library to monitor changes in the project directory.
